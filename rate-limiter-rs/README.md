# rate-limiter-rs

A distributed rate limiter component written in Rust, that follows a slightly
revised version of the [Token bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).

## Implementation details

Unlike traditional token bucket rate limiters, this implementation does not
refill the bucket at a fixed interval rate, but it creates a bucket on the
very first request belonging to the same ip address, and expire the bucket
after a configured deadline. This approach has the advantage that the same
origin cannot fire more than the maximum allowed requests in a period which
is across 2 adjacent windows. Another advantage compared to a classic token
bucket rate limiter is the fact that buckets are created only when the first
request actually occurs, so it should be slightly more efficient with regards
to memory consumption.

## Requirements

As of today, Redis is a strict requirement of this library.

## Building

```shell
cargo build
```

## Testing

```shell
cargo nextest run
```

&ast; Please note that some of the tests currently require a running Redis
instance on your local machine. To quickly start a redis server locally, you
can spy on the [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/rate_limiter_rs.yml).

## Areas of improvements

- [ ] More flexibility, right now the implementation is coupled to Redis
- [ ] Leverage the use of feature flags to selectively include specific
rate limiter implementations
- [ ] Redis: Add support for async
- [ ] Redis: Add support for TLS
- [ ] Improved local testing: Ideally it should be possible to mock redis,
responses if needed
